Well, it was all good and I started doing small projects‚Ä¶ now I‚Äôm somewhat an impatient person, and I get sometimes desperate if I want someting done<br>someway and it can‚Äôt be done‚Ä¶ So when I kept on going with RoR I saw it was turning to be very tedious to work with, and to develop, why? because, I don‚Äôt have a ‚ÄúDream <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=RIG&amp;defid=769942" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rig</a>‚Äú and I needed to wait like 30 seconds before the<br>server started it was crazy! ‚Ä¶ OH but wait, there‚Äôs more! ‚Ä¶ after the server loaded I had to wait like 10-20 seconds more until just the <code>hello world</code> example appeared in my browser‚Ä¶ so this is where things started to roll back down for me, I started to lose interest in the framework and decided to<br>try something new.</p><h1 id="A-New-Hope"><a href="#A-New-Hope" class="headerlink" title="A New Hope."></a>A New Hope.</h1><p>Yeah, pun intended ü§ô - Anyways, after my newly developed passion with RoR decreased to zero in like a week after using it, I started looking for different alternatives, something that could be fast on my <code>not-so-good-semi-gaming-slash-media-computer</code>, that‚Äôs where I kept looking and looking and came across with <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Django</a><br>When I saw the framework and btw made in Python! I couldn‚Äôt hold my amazement, it was shining brightly before my eyes, lighting the new hope again for a web framework where I could finally rely on! So what did I do? jumped straight into it, stared watching new video tutorials on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgGIqRFvFFk&amp;list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBlmzzFcLgDhKTTfNLfX1IK" target="_blank" rel="noopener">youtube</a> related to Django, started getting knowledge and getting known with the framework, etc., etc.</p><p>I even finished that series of video tutorials, the whole thing, cool, I started even working with <code>CBV</code> in Django that is <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/class-based-views/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>Class-Based-Views</code></a> which is just another way of doing stuff in your views via classes, instead of plain functions, after all of this, I made a little project based on that one we built, which basically what it was, is like an online lyrics website, where you could have albums, artists, lyrics of course, etc., etc.,<br>So the thing it was when I finished that project, I remember deciding to publish it or host it somewhere, and then‚Ä¶ there was the deployment phase, another thing that hit me, what was deployment? how could I do it? also any legals implications for publishing a lyrics website? long-story short, yes you need to have some kind of agency that ‚Äúlicenses‚Äù your website in order to have lyrics running on your website because all those lyrics are also copyrighted and a bunch of things that made lose hopes in Django, another cool project I did was a Youtube Video Downloader<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BZU5fhq.png" alt=""></p><blockquote><p>  (yes I know, yet another one) but of course this was for sake of developing and improving myself with the framework, also don‚Äôt mind the <code>We&#39;re Hiring</code> navigation tab xD</p></blockquote><h1 id="Wait‚Ä¶-Don‚Äôt-tell-me"><a href="#Wait‚Ä¶-Don‚Äôt-tell-me" class="headerlink" title="Wait‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt tell me!?"></a>Wait‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt tell me!?</h1><!-- but yeah, it seemed like for me it was the end with frameworks, django seemed so good and everything but I was missing two things, the deployment thing and another is that I wanted to get more `reactivity` with the framework, wanted to have more dynamic things on the websites that I built and I could only get that with AJAX/JQuery, but I'm a very persistent person and I never backdown out of anything so easily, so I kept on going, it was at this moment where I think I started to turn into a Framework Hopper, don't worry if you don't like reading this much, I will try to be short on this one.I started looking into other Web Frameworks, more specifically I looked into how to do dynamic stuff in the web app / websites I wanted to build, e.g. I wanted to have real-time things, like notifications, more reactivity, etc., etc. --><p><code>To Be Continued...</code></p>]]></content>
